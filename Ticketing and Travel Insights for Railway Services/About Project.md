**About This Project**
----
A railway company, RailConnect, aims to enhance customer satisfaction and optimise operations by leveraging data insights. 
They want to address recurring customer complaints about delayed trains, high ticket prices, and inconvenient ticketing methods.

As an analyst, I will be leveraging Python to examine RailConnect’s dataset for the first four months of the year. 
The goal is to derive insights that address recurring customer complaints, specifically focusing on train delays, high ticket prices, and inconvenient ticketing methods.”
